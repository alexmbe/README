This document is work in progress, it's creation has helped me identify and refine my thoughts and values. My hope is that it gives you some insights into how to work with me more effectively. This is not a replacement for actually getting to know each other. I very much value human interaction and look forward to connecting in-person.

## Professional

I started my career as a Software Engineer, then progressed to leadership roles in Engineering and Product. My professional focus is on building products that delight users and solve internet scale and software delivery challenges in a safe and secure way. Over the years I kept refining my leadership approach, but the foundation of it - largely due to my personal values has not changed. See [my LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexbello/) for more details about my professional background.

## My values 

My mission in life is to connect people to their happiness, so I put a strong emphasis on relationships and my values hierarchy is: person, then company. I believe that happy, informed, and productive humans build fantastic products. I optimize for humans. This means I'll prioritize people happiness over the company, if you're not happy you're likely negatively affecting the health of the company anyway. If you're not enjoying being part of a team I'll spend time supporting you and finding somewhere else in the company that is a better fit. If this company isn't for you and you want to leave I will help you find an amazing job at a different company.

Key points that define my leadership style

- I value open, authentic relationships
- I value a can-do, positive and collaborative attitude
- I value empathy
- I value working smarter over working harder
- I value autonomy over micro-management
- I value taking ownership of work and doing what you say
- I value a growth mindset
- I value experimentation and taking risks over not making mistakes
- I value direct and honest feedback
- I value giving info early over giving info at last-minute
- I value holding yourself and your team to high standards
- I value over-communication and transparency

## Trust

I will always fill up the trust bank to the fullest and work backward. What that means is that I will place my trust in you blindly, but if you repeatedly make the same mistakes again and again after being given feedback then you will slowly drain that trust bank.

## My role @ [Company]

- Engage, retain, and grow world-class talent
- Serve customers and the business by building products that delight users
- Responsible for long term product health and vision
- Provide business context and create roundabouts
- Give feedback and be unfailingly kind

## My management style

My management style is focused on giving you everything you need to succeed: space, security, facilitate trust of teammates, tools and as much context as possible. From there, I get out of the way. My goal is to work with you to find the right amount of stretch so you don't get bored and you don't get too stressed. 

## My assumptions

You are very good at your job. You'll let me know if you can't do your job. One of my main responsibilities is that you are setup for success and happiness. I’m not good at your job. I’ll provide the necessary context and ask questions to help vet ideas, but I won’t override.

## Career development

Your career is yours, you know how to best grow and in which areas. I can provide feedback, outside perspective and growth opportunities. You set priorities and let me know how I can help you achieve them. 

## Effective Communication with Me

I am generally a well-organised person. To communicate effectively with me, please be straight-up and explicit rather than assume I already know of something. If there are issues, surface them as quickly as possible. if you suspect something might become an issue, do some analysis and surface them as quickly as possible. If you have feedback for me, instead of waiting for our next meeting ping me and let's talk it out right away.
